\textbf{Supply Chain Management Example 1 - Simplex Method}

A manufacturing company produces three products: Product X, Product Y, and Product Z. The production of Product X requires 2 units of raw material A and 3 units of raw material B. The production of Product Y requires 4 units of raw material A and 1 unit of raw material B. The production of Product Z requires 3 units of raw material A and 2 units of raw material B. The company has 80 units of raw material A and 50 units of raw material B available. The profit per unit of Product X is $30, Product Y is $40, and Product Z is $50. The goal is to maximize the total profit.

The objective function:
Maximize 30x + 40y + 50z

Subject to:
2x + 4y + 3z <= 80 (Raw material A constraint)
3x + y + 2z <= 50 (Raw material B constraint)
x >= 0, y >= 0, z >= 0

\textbf{Solution:}
(Simplex method steps and the optimal production quantities for Product X, Product Y, and Product Z)

\textbf{Supply Chain Management Example 2 - Simplex Method}

A distribution company manages two warehouses: Warehouse A and Warehouse B. The transportation cost per unit from Warehouse A to three locations (Location X, Location Y, Location Z) is $10, $15, and $20 respectively. The transportation cost per unit from Warehouse B to the same three locations is $12, $18, and $22 respectively. The company has a total transportation budget of $2000. The goal is to minimize the total transportation cost.

The objective function:
Minimize 10x + 15y + 20z + 12u + 18v + 22w

Subject to:
x + y + z <= 1000 (Transportation limit from Warehouse A)
u + v + w <= 1000 (Transportation limit from Warehouse B)
x >= 0, y >= 0, z >= 0, u >= 0, v >= 0, w >= 0

\textbf{Solution:}
(Simplex method steps and the optimal transportation quantities from Warehouse A and Warehouse B to each location)
